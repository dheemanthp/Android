Android:
=========
The Android OS uses a priority queue to assist in managing activities running on the device. 

1)Activity:
2)Intent:
3)Services:
4)Broadcast Reciever:
5)Content Provider: 
a)The moment we install whatsapp , the data from the contacts application by a special Component content provider.
b) if one application wants to share data to another application , it shares through Content Provider


How Android system understand which layout is to be shown: Manifest.xml
========================================================================
Entry point (AndroidManifest.xml) -> Intent Filter(action= main) loads that specific activity
-> Activity(calls on create) -> calls setContentView-> layout file in res folder(to inflate)

List characterstics of activity:
================================
1)Actvity is always associated with UI
2)No two UI have the same activity (most important)[one layout will be inflated by one activity only]
3)Activity has its own life cycle - onCreate();
a)it looks up for the laytout to be inflated

Lift cycle of activity:
=======================
1)onCreate(): looks for layout to be inflated , instantiates and registers
2)onStart() : calls onResume()
4)onResume() , activity is shown on the screen
5)Activity Running
6)onPause() - another activity comes into the foreground
7)onStop() - the activity is no longer visible 
8)onDestroy() - the activity is finished
9)Activity Shutdown

What are intents
=================
facilitates communication b/w components in many ways
a)start activity
b)start a service
c) deliver broadcast

Implicit Intent: opens google.com (b/w 2 applications)
Intent webIntent = new Intent(Intent.ACTION_VIEW, Uri.parse("http://www.google.com"));
startActivity(webIntent);

Explicit Intent: (in the same application)
Opening another Activity in the same application 
a)you mention the current Application context
b) if you want to pass data from one activity to another activity in the same application
then use the put extra Data
Intent openNewActivity = new Intent(getApplicationContext(),Activity2.class);
//Directly Set Data in Intent object
openNewActivity.putExtra("Name","Dheemanth");
openNewActivity.putExtra("UserName","xyz");
openNewActivity.putExtra("isRegsitered",true);
startActivity(openNewActivity);

//in the activity2 class
Intent intentObject = getIntent();
String name = intentObject.getStringExtra("Name");
String userName = intentObject.getStringExtra("userName");
boolean isRegsitered = intentObject.getBooleanExtra("isRegsitered",true);
Toast.makeText(getApplicationContext(), "Name " + name +
                                        "UserName " + UserName + 
                                        "Registration Status :" + isRegsitered);
