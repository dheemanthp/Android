#Declarative UI's Inside XML

Binding the gap between code and XML

Example:
If you put tag like "layout" in XML file, you will get a ***Binding Class ProfileBinding***

---
<!-- profile.xml -->
><layout>
><LinearLayout>
>//If add variables to this layout , then setters and getters are generated in the Binding Class
>     <data>
>      <variable>
>      name = "user"
>      type = ".user"
>      </variable>
>     </data>
></LinearLayout>
></layout>'
