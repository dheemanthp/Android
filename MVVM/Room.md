```
In Room 2.1 Full TEXT search has been added
there is a MATCH keyword introduced , where you can do huge queries efficiently.
```
Database Views:
You can use views just like normal SQL
hence you can query the VIews as though they are normal Database

Expand RX support:
@Insert returns completable
The Completable class represents a deferred computation without any value but only indication for completion or exception.
@Update returns Single
The Single class implements the Reactive Pattern for a single value response.
Single behaves similarly to Observable except that it can only emit either a single successful value or an error (there is no "onComplete" notification as there is for an Observable).
@Query returns completable
The Completable class represents a deferred computation without any value but only indication for completion or exception.
