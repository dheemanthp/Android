Virtual Memory:
CPU : process a given program
Physical or Main memory or RAM are one and the same . they have a limited storage.
Only pages that are really needed are loaded on to the physical memory , and rest are in the secondary memory(backup storage).
every program only knows the logical address.
logical address is translated into physical address by MMU.
if the page is not found in page table then it is loaded on to the Physcial memory by the operating system.
