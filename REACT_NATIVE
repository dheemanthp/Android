React is a component based java script library used for building UI, and was created by Facebook.
React Native is a javascript framework for writing real natively rendering mobile applications
for ios and android.

java/kotlin for android
objective C/swift for IOS apps
React Native allows native applications to suit both IOS and Android
X code/Android studio->unless you use Expo(free and complete workflow for creating
next gen apps for ios and android) 
Build Cross platform native apps with ease
Expo gives low level hooks , push notifications and mapping

React.js is for web
ReactNative does not DIV Tags
Some of the components that works on IOS does not work on android
Clearly not an 1.0 Framework.
Learn once write everywhere , is not really true, is only true for the structure.
Component Libraries.
For CRUD apps then React Native is good.
If there is more of animation/fluid 60 frame per second UI , then flutter is better.
If it is games , then you want to use Native code and not cross platform tools.
For android -> JAva/Kotlin/XML, super familiar with XCODE, gradle and build process
For IOS -> objective C/swift , cocopods
