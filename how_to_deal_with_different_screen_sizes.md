Use view dimensions that allow the layout to resize
Create alternative UI layouts according to the screen configuration
Provide bitmaps that can stretch with the views


***Use ConstraintLayout***
The best way to create a responsive layout for different screen sizes is to use ConstraintLayout 
as the base layout in your UI. ConstraintLayout allows you to specify the position and size for each view according to spatial relationships with other views in the layout. This way, all the views can move and stretch together as the screen size changes.
