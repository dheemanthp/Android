-- Advantages and Disadvantages
Following are some of the advantages of using Kotlin for your application development.

Easy Language − Kotlin is a functional language and very easy to learn. The syntax is pretty much similar to Java, hence it is very easy to remember. Kotlin is more expressive, which makes your code more readable and understandable.

Concise − Kotlin is based on JVM and it is a functional language. Thus, it reduce lots of boiler plate code used in other programming languages.

Runtime and Performance − Better performance and small runtime.

Interoperability − Kotlin is mature enough to build an interoperable application in a less complex manner.

Brand New − Kotlin is a brand new language that gives developers a fresh start. It is not a replacement of Java, though it is developed over JVM. It is accepted as the first official language of android development. Kotlin can be defined as - Kotlin = JAVA + extra updated new features.

Following are some of the disadvantages of Kotlin.

Namespace declaration − Kotlin allows developers to declare the functions at the top level. However, whenever the same function is declared in many places of your application, then it is hard to understand which function is being called.

No Static Declaration − Kotlin does not have usual static handling modifier like Java, which can cause some problem to the conventional Java developer.


JAVA :
Java is not a functional language, it is fundamentally an Object Oriented language that 
allows us to adopt some functional concepts in so far as we enforce their correct implementation 
through developer discipline.
